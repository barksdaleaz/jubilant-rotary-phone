# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

PROJECT 1 is a website where users can create a profile, search for books based on ISBN, author, title, or year published, and then check out the average rating for that book. They can also leave a review and rate the book if they wish.

FILES:

APPLICATION.PY is the overall code using Flask.
PROJECT1HELPERS.PY is a small collection of helpful code such as "login required". Based off CS50's helpers.py from previous projects.
IMPORT.PY is a file that imports a CSV provided by CS50W into a database hosted by Heroku.
INDEX1.HTML is the opening page.
LAYOUT1.HTML is the overall HTML layout for almost every page.
LOGIN.HTML is a login page based on a Bootstrap snippet.
PROJECT1APOLOGY.HTML is an apology page in case of errors.
PROJECT1REGISTER.HTML is the registration page.
PROJECT1RESULTS.HTML is the page for each specific book.
PROJECT1SEARCH.HTML is the general searching page.
PROJECT1SEARCHRESULTS.HTML is the page that shows the results from the search. This is different from "results" page as it shows a table of several books, not information for one book.

NOTE: the website looks pretty basic, and doesn't have fancy HTML.
