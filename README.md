This is a collection of the code I have written for the CS50/CS50W 2020 course (through EdX). Some of the code requires outside/extra files or code that was provided. Those files are not provided here, and can be found through the CS50/CS50W course information, if you are enrolled.

PSETS FOLDER: code for most of the problem sets we had to submit. In Python and C.

FIRSTSITE FOLDER: the first HTML/CSS-only website we had to create for the CS50 Web Track.
