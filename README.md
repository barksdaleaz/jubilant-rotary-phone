This is a collection of the code I have written for the CS50/CS50W 2020 course (through EdX). Some of the code requires outside/extra files or code that was provided. Those files are not provided here, and can be found through the CS50/CS50W course information, if you are enrolled.

PSETS FOLDER: code for most of the problem sets we had to submit. In Python and C.

FIRSTSITE FOLDER: the first HTML/CSS-only website we had to create for the CS50 Web Track.

FINANCE FOLDER: the second website we had to build for the CS50 Web Track - HTML/CSS, SQL database, API & Python. It is a finance website where users can search real stock info, buy/sell them (with fake money) and watch their portfolio grow!

PROJECT1 FOLDER: the second project in the CS50W course. Built a web application similar to how Goodreads works, where users can search for books, rate, and leave a comment, and see others' reviews. Based on the Goodreads' API. Implements Heroku PostgreSQL database.
